# HiLo
You have a card. A second will be shown to you, but only after you guess: will it be higher? or lower? For each correct guess, you'll get 100 points. But for every wrong guess you'll lose 75. Watch out for draws, you can't win on those. You'll start with 300 points. Try to get the highest score you can!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. On Windows, start the program by running the following command.
```
py HiLo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- HiLo                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
